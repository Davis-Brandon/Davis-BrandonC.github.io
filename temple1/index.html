    <p>In 1920, LDS Church President Heber J. Grant announced plans to construct a temple in the city of Mesa, Arizona. This temple would be an oasis in the desert – a sanctuary – for members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints living outside historically LDS communities. Instead of asking church members to move to Utah to be near temples at the beginning of the 20th century, church leaders started taking the temples to the people. Construction of a temple in Mesa, Arizona complemented temples being built in Laie, Hawaii and Cardston, Alberta, Canada. </p>

    <p>At last came the long expected day. The people had been waiting quietly and anxiously for over an hour before the temple doors. It was Tuesday, November 6, 1945, and the Saints from the Republic of Mexico and Spanish-speaking Saints from the United States were about to enter the Arizona Temple to participate in ordinances for the first time in their native language.”</p>

    <p>But these Saints had waited much longer than this quiet hour. Years of planning and preparation, hope and faith had preceded this moment. As early as October 23, 1927, President Heber J. Grant had prayed at the dedication of the Arizona Temple</p>

    <p>The construction of temples on the American continent, as revealed in the Book of Mormon, dates from an early period in the Nephite history. These sacred buildings were in use among the Nephites throughout their existence as a nation. After the destruction of the Nephites, the building of temples was continued by their Lamanite conquerors.</p>

    <p>It was not until the gospel was again restored to the earth in these latter days, however, that the true purpose of a temple dedicated to the Most High became known among the children of men. The English-speaking Latter-day Saints were the first to enjoy the blessings of the house of the Lord, since it was in this language that the ordinances were first performed. However, Lorin F. Jones, president of the Spanish-American Mission, which covered the states of Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and California, had a great desire to have the Church provide the members of his mission with the opportunity of receiving the temple ordinances in their own language.</p>
