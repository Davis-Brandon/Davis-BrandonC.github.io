        <h4>Who are we</h4>
        <p>Contrast - The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the official name of the religion commonly called the Mormon Church. It was established April 6, 1830, by Joseph Smith, the first president of the Church. We believe he was called by God to be a prophet in this modern era, just as Moses and Abraham were called in biblical times. Joseph Smith saw God the Father and Jesus Christ in a vision after praying to know which church to join. They called on him to restore the church Christ had organized when He was on the earth, with the proper organization and priesthood authority that had been lost shortly after the Savior’s death.

From the original six members when the Church was first formed in 1830, the restored Church of Jesus Christ has now grown to a membership of over 15 million people, living on six continents. After Joseph Smith’s death, an unbroken succession of prophets have led the Church; these prophets and other Church leaders who serve with them are always striving to bring individuals to a better understanding and greater love for the gospel of Jesus Christ. </p>
